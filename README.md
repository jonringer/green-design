# Green Design

WIP: A graphical tool for designing and planning gardens, farms, and landscapes.

Currently do no have time to work on this, but created this repository as a
"manifesto" for my intent to follow through with seeing this done in a few years.

## Roadmap

- Stage 1 (Linux native GUI, because linux is what I use, and it's free and accessible to many)
  - Draw area
    - Grow beds, fields, trees, orchards, paths, lawns, fences, buildings, and other landscape features
  - Crop/Plant rotations
    - Recommended seeding/platning/harvesting schedules for gardens or farms
    - Input costs (fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, etc) 
    - Project revenue (paid?)
    - Allow for user to adjust timelines
      - Hardeness zone as factor?
      - Microclimate adjustments
  - Build small database of commonly used plants
    - https://pfaf.org/ ? Not small, but external project
    - Allow users to input their own cultivars
- Stage 2
  - Windows Client (maybe paid)
  - MacOS Client? (maybe paid)
- Stage 3
  - Hosted Collaboration Service (paid)
    - Backup services
    - Allow for in-app collaboration with others or multiple devices

Unorganized list of "good ideas":

- Auto-collect weather data from location
  - Average rainfall (year or month)
  - Light hours + intensity
  - Temperature
  - First + Last frost date
- Allow input of height of objects + light permability + latitude to calculate hours of sunlight on land in a certain month
  - Render shaded and light micro-climates
- Pre-render from satelite photo
  - Dimension estimation
  - Satelite vs logical overlay
  - Contour lines?
- Permaculture/Earthwork Planning:
  - Allow for depth to be input to calculate water runoff, collection, capacity
    - Extreme drought or rain scenarios?
  - Potential keypoints
  - Recommended swale lines
  - Recommended keyline lines
- Future timelapses and extrapolation:
  - Projected havest amounts
  - Landscape renders in 1,2,3,4,5 years
- Water catchment calculator
  - Roof area + monthly rain averages -> amount of rain water availability
- Animal Husbandry
  - Inclusion of animals as part of input and revenue streams
    - Nutrient cylcing as ferilizer
- Cover crop interaction with fields and grow beds
- Alternative planting methods
  - Inteplanting (multi-species planting withing same growing area, e.g. three sisters)
  - Alley planting (planting between perennials)
- Succession planting schedules
- Order-based planner (for CSAs or contract farming, paid?)
  - Given an order volume, previous growth history and risk buffer -> calcuate how much to plant
    - For CSAs, allow for succession planning
- Plant recommendations
  - Similar to https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx, but we can automate most of the climate parameters
- Soil Health
  - Would like to somehow quantify soil health and allow introspection. :/
